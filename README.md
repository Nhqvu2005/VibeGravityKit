## 🎩 What is VibeGravityKit?

Imagine having a full-stack engineering team living inside your terminal. 
**VibeGravityKit** isn't just a collection of scripts; it's a philosophy. It turns your LLM into a coordinated squad of 11 specialized agents, from the **Architect** who designs your database, to the **Security Engineer** who guards your keys.

But here's the kicker: **We hate wasting tokens.**
Most AI coding tools are sloppy. They read entire files just to change one line. We don't do that here.
- **Context Manager**: Minifies your code before the AI sees it. (Saves ~50% tokens).
- **Diff Applier**: Applies surgical patches instead of rewriting files. (Saves ~90% tokens).

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The 11-Agent Dream Team
| Role | Skillset |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Planner & Leader** | Strategy, User Stories, Risk Analysis. |
| **Architect & Designer** | Database Schema (Prisma), OpenAPI Specs, Design Systems. |
| **Dev Team (Web/Mobile)** | React, Vue, Expo, Flutter, Vanilla JS — we code it all. |
| **QA & Security** | Zero-token Test Gen & Vulnerability Scanning. |
| **DevOps & SRE** | Docker, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code. |

### 2. Token Economy Engine
We treat input tokens like gold. Our "Smart Tools" ensure you only pay for what matters.
- `context-manager`: "Read this file, but strip the fluff."
- `diff-applier`: "Change these 3 lines. Don't touch the rest."
- `git-manager`: "Commit this with a semantic message."

### 3. One-Command Setup
Install once, use everywhere. Deploy your AI team to any new project with a single command.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Install Global CLI
Run this **once** to install the VibeGravityKit CLI on your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Start-Vibe-Coding/VibeGravityKit.git
cd VibeGravityKit
pip install .
```

### 2. Initialize in a Project
Go to any project folder (new or existing) and summon your team:
```bash
cd my-new-project
vibe --init
```
*Boom! The `.agent` folder is created, and your 11 agents are ready to work.*

### 3. Start building!
Now, just chat with your IDE (Cursor/Windsurf/Vibe):
> "@[/planner] I want to build a Spotify clone."
> "@[/frontend-dev] Create the login screen using the design system."
